<h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

# Definitions

* Stability - an algorithm that retains the order of same-value elements in the sorted list

## Comparison Sorting

Compare elements and shift to left or right. Big Theta (n log n)


## Integer Sorting

Compute position by determining how many elements are smaller or larger
